# simple_tiny_scraping_project

Libraries used:
* beautiful soup
* for parsing html5lib
* requests
* regular expressions
* datetime 

All this program does is scrape some dates from https://www.berlin.de for Sundays, during which shops in Berlin are open and then compare them against today's date. If itÂ´s a match, it returns True.
